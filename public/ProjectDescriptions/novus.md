I started as a one-man team, but I currently work with 6 other developers and many more contributors. I focused on the core systems of the game, like the flight model, UI/UX, weather, etc.

## Flight Model

I developed the flight model following Object-Oriented Programming patterns. This made it really easy to scale and customize the flight model to different types of planes. For example, there are "Surface" and "Engine" classes with configurable parameters like wingspan, surface area, thrust, etc.

It was so developer-friendly that other developers have since added 5 functional planes without knowing how the underlying code works.
